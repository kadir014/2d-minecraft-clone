This is a 2D clone of the well-known game Minecraft made in Python using [Pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) and [ModernGL](https://github.com/moderngl/moderngl) \
I started this mostly as a self-improvement project to learn new concepts like procuderal terrain generation, handling infinite worlds with chunks, different lighting techniques and scenarios in a tile-based system etc...
